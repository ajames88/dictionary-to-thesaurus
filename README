This project is coded in version python2.7.10.

The following command can be entered into the terminal to run this program:

  "./run <letter of the alphabet whose thesaurus to be compared>"

  Example: "./run A"

  NOTE: the './runAll' script will run the entire alphabet, this process
  took my machine over 12 hours to complete

The purpose of this project is to create a thesaurus using the GNU dictionary
through pairing words with similar significant words in their definitions.
This thesaurus will then be checked for accuracy against the thesaurus parsed
from the Moby Thesaurus.

The output of this program will appear in a text file named
'<letter>output.txt'. The generatedThesaurus will appear in a file named
'thesaurusFor<letter>.txt'. The parsed dictionary will appear in the
ParsedDictionary directory, and the parsed thesaurus will appear in the file
'mobyThesaurus.txt'.


For purposes of decreasing run-time, this program will only compute a thesaurus
for all the dictionary entries starting the a given letter.

The file 'words.txt' contains a list of entries from the Moby Thesaurus.
The Moby Thesaurus has been placed into the public domain by
'moby-thesarus.org' and the file 'words.txt' was taken from the open source
project associated with 'moby-thesarus.org'. Please reference
'https://github.com/words/moby' for more information.

This directory contains python files that have the following functions:

  ParseMobyThesaurus.py: parses thesaurus entries from 'words.txt' and write
    them to 'mobythesarus.txt'.
  ParseDictionary.py: parses the dictionary from the files in the gcide-0.52
    directory and writes them to the files in the ParsedDictionary directory
  CreateMyThesaurus.py: uses the dictionary files in the ParsedDictionary
    directory to create a thesaurus
  Compare.py: compares the generated thesaurus to the Moby Thesaurus
