This project is coded in version python2.7.10.

The following command can be entered into the terminal to run this program:

  "./run <uppercase letter of the alphabet whose thesaurus to be compared>"

  Example: "./run A"

  NOTE: the './runAll' script will run the entire alphabet, this process
  took my machine over 12 hours to complete

The purpose of this project is to create a thesaurus using the GNU dictionary
using the cosine similarities of vectors of td-idf values to find synonyms.
This thesaurus will then be checked for accuracy against the thesaurus parsed
from the Moby Thesaurus.

The output of this program will appear in a text file named
'<letter>output.txt'. The generatedThesaurus will appear in a file named
'thesaurusFor<letter>.txt'. The parsed dictionary will appear in the
ParsedDictionary directory, and the parsed thesaurus will appear in the file
'mobyThesaurus.txt'.


For purposes of decreasing run-time, this program will only compute a thesaurus
for all the dictionary entries starting the a given letter.

The file 'words.txt' contains a list of entries from the Moby Thesaurus.
The Moby Thesaurus has been placed into the public domain by
'moby-thesarus.org' and the file 'words.txt' was taken from the open source
project associated with 'moby-thesarus.org'. Please reference
'https://github.com/words/moby' for more information.

This directory contains python files that have the following functions:

  ParseMobyThesaurus.py: parses thesaurus entries from 'words.txt' and write
    them to 'mobythesarus.txt'.
  ParseDictionary.py: parses the dictionary from the files in the gcide-0.52
    directory and writes them to the files in the ParsedDictionary directory
  CreateMyThesaurus.py: uses the dictionary files in the ParsedDictionary
    directory to create a thesaurus
  Compare.py: compares the generated thesaurus to the Moby Thesaurus
